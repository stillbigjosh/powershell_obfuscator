# PowerShell Obfuscator

A comprehensive PowerShell script obfuscator designed for red team operations. This tool applies multiple layers of obfuscation to PowerShell scripts while preserving their functionality.

### Obfuscation Techniques
- Replaces all user-defined identifiers with randomized names
- Applies various encoding methods including:
  - Base64 encoding with .NET method calls
  - Unicode escape sequences (%u00XX format)
  - Hexadecimal encoding
  - ASCII byte array representations
- **Control Flow Obfuscation**: 
  - Inserts dummy conditional statements (`if`, `switch`, `for` loops)
  - Adds try-catch blocks throughout code
  - Implements do-while constructs that execute once
- Replaces standard cmdlets with shorter aliases (e.g., `Get-Process` â†’ `gps`)
- Adds random variable assignments that don't affect functionality
- Non-executing code to increase entropy and evade signature detection

### Capabilities
- Processes large scripts in chunks for memory optimization
- Works on both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core
- Built-in PowerShell syntax checking capabilities
- Verifies obfuscated scripts maintain original behavior
- Three levels (low, medium, high) for tailored obfuscation

## Testing Result
When tested against a 17.7KB PowerShell script (Get-ComputerDetail.ps1):
- 31.7KB (+79.1% increase)
- 100% maintained original functionality
- All major techniques consistently implemented

## Limitations
1. Highly obfuscated output is significantly larger than original
2. Obfuscated scripts may have slightly increased execution time
3. Near impossible to debug or modify obfuscated scripts
4. May not handle all PowerShell language constructs perfectly

## Usage
```bash
python3 powershell_obfuscator.py input.ps1 -o obfuscated.ps1 -l high
```

Options:
- `-l, --level`: Obfuscation intensity (low, medium, high)
- `-t, --test`: Run functionality tests after obfuscation
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging

## Conclusion
The PowerShell Obfuscator provides obfuscation suitable for advanced red team operations.
